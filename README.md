<h3>Simplify your Spotify playlist creation experience</h3>

Ever wanted to create a Spotify playlist on the go? Or a playlist starter? I programmed a web app that does just that!

Playlist creation has become a tedious task for me on Spotify. It takes hours to construct the perfect bucket of songs that matches a certain vibe or feel. I'm sure we've all been there before. Public playlists are a good start, but what if I ONLY want pieces I have interacted with before?

To achieve this, I used the Spotify API to retrieve data on songs in users' playlists and Liked Songs.
