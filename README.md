## The Challenge
Playlist creation can be a daunting and time-consuming task. Crafting the perfect collection of songs that encapsulates a particular mood or ambiance often takes hours of searching and curating. We've all been there. While public playlists offer a solid starting point, they might cater to something other than our specific preferences and interactions with music.

## The Solution
To address this challenge, I've harnessed the capabilities of the Spotify API and leveraged data science techniques to create a solution that simplifies and enhances playlist creation. The heart of the solution lies in generating playlists tailored to your individual musical journey and interactions.

## Features
Personalization: The web app seamlessly connects with your Spotify account, giving you a personalized playlist-generation experience.
Intelligent Song Selection: The app identifies songs that match your chosen criteria using a blend of data science methodologies, including TF-IDF analysis on track genres and cosine similarity ranking.
Effortless Integration: Once the playlist is generated, you have the option to add it directly to your Spotify library, making it a convenient tool for both playlist starters and those in need of an on-the-go playlist.

## Post Retrospective
### Successes
Here are a few milestones I hit during the three months of developing this app:
<ul>
  <li>
    Learned four new languages: <b>Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    Learned the foundation of both frontend and backend programming in web development, and applied them
  </li>
  <li>
    Applied the steps involved in data analysis: data retrieval, data cleaning, data processing and intrepretation of results
  </li>
  <li>
    Learned the importance of receiving user input and feedback
  </li>
</ul>

### Failures
I had many roadblocks and failures while developing the app. I failed to:
<ul>
  <li>
    Implement a secure database
  </li>
  <li>
    Maximize efficiency - app takes up to 30 seconds to initialize
  </li>
  <li>
    Have complete error handling
  </li>
  <li>
    Store user information securely
  </li>
</ul>
I have looked into each issues, and have began implementing solutions in other projects.

### Key take aways
Prior to this project, I had no web-development or data science experience. However, within three months, I was able to create a functioning product that applies both. Although not perfect, I learned many valuable lessons that I can apply to future projects. The following are my key take-aways:
<ul>
  <li>
    Know what you don't know
  </li>
  <li>
    Set realistic goals and stick to them
  </li>
  <li>
    Focus on the right things
  </li>
  <li>
    Think about the users
  </li>
  <li>
    Garbage in, garbage out
  </li>
  <li>
    Learn to learn <b>fast</b>!
  </li>
  <li>
    Read. The. Docs!
  </li>
</ul>
